# Thermal Face Contrastive GAN

`src` contains scripts for TFC-GAN original implementation for the ECCV paper

`TFC-GAN-FFT` contains developmental scripts for TFC-GAN using a global or patch-based FFT loss.
- `debiased_V4` includes a new architecture using contrastive FFT losses for 4 patches, as well as two classifier networks for regional ethnicity classification of thermal regions of the face.
